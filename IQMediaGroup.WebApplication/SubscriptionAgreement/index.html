            SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT</h4>
        <p>
            <i>Last Updated: August 14, 2013</i></p>
        <p>
            THIS SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT (“AGREEMENT”) IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN
            iQ MEDIA GROUP LLC (“IQ MEDIA”) AND THE PERSON OR ENTITY (“CUSTOMER”) ORDERING iQ
            MEDIA’S SERVICES, AND GOVERNS THE PROVISION AND USE OF SUCH SERVICES.
        </p>
        <p>
            BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, EITHER BY CLICKING A BOX INDICATING ACCEPTANCE OR BY
            AGREEING TO A QUOTATION (A “QUOTE”) THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER AGREES
            TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF THE PERSON ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT IS ENTERING
            INTO IT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, SUCH PERSON REPRESENTS AND
            WARRANTS THAT HE OR SHE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THIS AGREEMENT,
            IN WHICH CASE THE TERM “CUSTOMER” SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY. IF THE PERSON ACCEPTING
            THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY OR DOES NOT AGREE WITH THIS AGREEMENT,
            THEN HE OR SHE MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND CUSTOMER MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.
            BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED ABOVE, CUSTOMER INTENDS TO BE
            LEGALLY BOUND BY THE TERMS HEREOF.
        </p>
        <p>
            1. <u>Services, Quotes and Pricing</u>. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
            Agreement and any applicable Quote(s) (which are hereby incorporated into this Agreement
            by reference), Customer hereby subscribes for access to iQ Media’s media intelligence
            and research services. Access may be either agency-level access (“Agency Access”)
            or self-service access (“Self-Service Access”), as specified in a Quote. The product
            features and accessible media types, as well as the fees and payment schedule for
            the services, shall be specified in each Quote. A Quote must be mutually executed
            by both parties to be binding and effective. At any time, Customer may also request
            iQ Media to perform custom or specialty services not included in iQ Media’s standard
            service offerings for Customer’s level of access; the features, pricing and any
            additional terms applicable to such services shall be specified in one or more “Custom
            Service Quotes,” which shall be effective upon mutual execution by the parties and
            thereupon incorporated in this Agreement by reference. The services ordered by Customer
            from time to time and described in the Quotes are collectively referred to as the
            “Services.”
        </p>
        <p>
            2. <u>Payment</u>. Payments shall be made within thirty (30) days of the receipt
            of an invoice from iQ Media. Payments shall be made to iQ Media’s Billing Department,
            with an address of <b>10 Campus Boulevard, Newtown Square, PA 19073</b>. Returned
            or late payments may be subject to additional fees. If Customer fails to make any
            required payment, Customer shall also reimburse iQ Media for its reasonable costs
            of collection.</p>
        <p>
            3. <u>License</u>. As more fully provided below, Customer’s license rights are determined
            by the level of access specified in the applicable Quote. Under no circumstances
            may Customer exceed (or permit a third party to exceed) the level of access granted
            in the Quote, or access or use content, features or functionality in the iQ Media
            platform or database that are not authorized for Customer’s level of access as provided
            in the Quote and this Agreement. In addition to the license terms below, Customer’s
            use of content removal functionality may be subject to additional terms, such as
            click-wrap agreements or terms of use, which shall supplement this Agreement and
            shall be binding upon Customer (and its End-Users, as defined below, if Customer
            has purchased Agency Access) with respect to such activities. Such additional terms
            are hereby incorporated and made a part of this Agreement by reference.</p>
        <p>
            <i>If Customer has purchased Self-Service Access, the following license terms shall
                apply:</i></p>
        <p>
            iQ Media grants Customer a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license
            during the term of each Quote to (i) access and use those features and functions
            of iQ Media’s proprietary online research platform specified in the applicable Quote
            to search, and create, store and view clips of, media content in the categories
            specified in such Quote, all solely for the purpose of time-shifted internal viewing
            and not for sale, licensing, re-broadcast, distribution, syndication or public display;
            and (ii) use iQ Media’s proprietary analytics platform to request media content
            data summaries to be used for Customer’s internal business purposes. Without limiting
            the foregoing, Customer shall NOT grant third parties access to the Services, the
            iQ Media content database or any content obtained from the database, or use the
            Services for service bureau-type activities. Customer’s license to access iQ Media’s
            platform and database is limited to the number of seats purchased by Customer. Each
            seat will be assigned an individual login and password. Each login and password
            may not be used by anyone within Customer’s organization other than the licensed
            user and may not be shared with any third party.</p>
        <p>
            <i>If Customer has purchased Agency Access, the following license terms shall apply:</i></p>
        <p>
            iQ Media grants Customer a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license
            during the term of each Quote to (i) access and use those features and functions
            of iQ Media’s proprietary online research platform specified in the applicable Quote
            to search, and create, store and view clips of, media content in the categories
            specified in such Quote; (ii) make such clips available in accordance with applicable
            law to End-Users who have a need for time-shifted viewing as part of their relationship
            with Customer, and not for sale, re-broadcast, distribution, syndication or public
            display, except with the prior consent of the applicable rights holders; and (iii)
            use iQ Media’s proprietary analytics platform to request media content data summaries
            to be used for Customer’s and its End-Users’ internal business purposes. As used
            herein, “End-User” means a customer, client or other constituent of Customer which,
            prior to receiving content from the iQ Media database, has executed a written contract
            with Customer containing restrictions on the use of media content and disclaimers
            that are fully consistent with and at least as strenuous as those in this Agreement.
            Customer’s license to access iQ Media’s platform and database is limited to the
            number of seats purchased by Customer. Each seat will be assigned an individual
            login and password. Each login and password may not be used by anyone within Customer’s
            organization other than the licensed user. Customer shall not share any login or
            password for iQ Media’s platform and database with any third party, shall not grant
            third parties access to the Services, and also shall not grant third parties access
            to content obtained from the iQ Media database except for End-Users in accordance
            with the license above. Customer is responsible for ensuring End-Users’ compliance
            with all laws and all other obligations applicable to Customer, whether under this
            Agreement or otherwise. In the event of a complaint from a rights holder concerning
            content provided to End-Users, Customer shall promptly provide iQ Media upon request
            with any information about End-Users who may have received the relevant content
            and shall take all actions requested to limit or terminate their right and ability
            to access or use such content. If iQ Media in good faith believes that a particular
            End-User is violating this Agreement, Customer shall also take all actions requested
            to deny such person further access to content from the iQ Media database.</p>
        <p>
            <i>The following terms shall apply to both Self-Service Access and Agency Access:</i></p>
        <p>
            Customer shall immediately report to iQ Media any unauthorized access of a login
            and shall be responsible for all activities occurring under each login, whether
            authorized or not. Customer is solely responsible for complying with this Section
            3 and applicable copyright and other laws and shall not use, download, copy, modify,
            re-broadcast, distribute, perform or display media content in any infringing or
            illegal manner.</p>
        <p>
            4. <u>Fair Use Notice; Complaints and Improper Uses</u>. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
            iQ MEDIA IS AN ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDER ONLY, DOES NOT SELL, DISTRIBUTE OR SYNDICATE
            CONTENT AND DOES NOT OWN THE MEDIA CONTENT ACCESSIBLE IN THE iQ MEDIA DATABASE.
            ALL VIEWING, CLIPPING, DOWNLOADING, STORAGE, AND OTHER USAGE OF CONTENT IS STRICTLY
            LIMITED TO “FAIR USES” UNDER COPYRIGHT LAW. IF CUSTOMER’S INTENDED USAGE OF CONTENT
            MAY NOT CONSTITUTE “FAIR USE”, iQ MEDIA STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT CUSTOMER CONTACT
            THE RELEVANT RIGHTS HOLDER TO OBTAIN A SUITABLE LICENSE IN SUCH CONTENT. In order
            to protect rights holders, iQ Media uses digital rights management technology (“DRM”)
            to monitor and trace the usage and sharing of clips and block potentially infringing
            activities. Customer and (where Customer has purchased Agency Access) the End-Users
            shall not circumvent or disable iQ Media’s DRM, and Customer agrees that iQ Media,
            in its sole discretion, may immediately and without notice suspend or terminate
            access to the Services or clipped content if (a) Customer fails to pay any amount
            due under this Agreement; or (b) iQ Media receives a complaint from a rights holder
            about Customer or believes in good faith that Customer (or its End-Users, if applicable)
            have breached this Agreement. iQ Media shall have no liability whatsoever relating
            to any suspension, denial or termination of access to the Services or content where
            permitted by this Agreement.</p>
        <p>
            5. <u>Confidentiality and Proprietary Rights</u>. Customer agrees to keep confidential
            and not to disclose to any third party, except as expressly permitted in this Agreement
            or with iQ Media’s prior written consent, iQ Media’s proprietary media player technology,
            media monitoring, clipping and business logic platforms, media content data summaries,
            and all other non-public business or technical information relating to the Services
            (collectively, together with any modifications, improvements, updates and customizations
            thereof, the “iQ Media Materials”), which Customer acknowledges constitute iQ Media’s
            proprietary information and trade secrets. Title to the Services and the iQ Media
            Materials (excluding the underlying media content) is at all times owned by iQ Media,
            along with all trademarks, service marks and trade names used with the iQ Media
            Materials and the Services and all associated goodwill. Customer agrees (i) not
            to copy, distribute, modify, display, de-compile, disassemble or reverse-engineer
            the Services or the iQ Media Materials, or combine or merge them with any other
            product, service or materials, without iQ Media’s prior written consent; and (ii)
            that any permitted copies shall bear iQ Media’s proprietary notices as appearing
            in the original material. iQ Media may refer to Customer by name and logo as a customer
            in its promotional material, but otherwise shall not use Customer’s trademarks or
            logos in any promotional material or public communication without Customer’s prior
            written approval (except as required by law). All rights relating to intellectual
            property which are not expressly granted to the other party in this Agreement are
            reserved.</p>
        <p>
            6. <u>Term and Termination</u>. This Agreement shall continue in force until terminated
            by either party in accordance with this Section 6. Unless different term provisions
            are specified in a Quote, the initial term of each Quote is twelve (12) months,
            after which the Quote will automatically renew for successive additional terms of
            equal length, at iQ Media’s then-current pricing for any ongoing Services if previously
            communicated by iQ Media, unless either party gives the other notice of non-renewal
            at least ninety (90) days before the renewal date. iQ Media may terminate this Agreement
            or any Quote hereunder upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Customer if
            Customer materially breaches the terms of either this Agreement or such Quote and
            such breach is not cured within the notice period; provided, however, that iQ Media
            may terminate immediately without prior notice in the circumstances described in
            Section 3 and 4 above. Customer may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’
            prior written notice to iQ Media if iQ Media materially breaches the terms of this
            Agreement and such breach is not cured within the notice period; however, if there
            is more than one Quote outstanding and a breach relates only to the Services provided
            under a particular Quote, then Customer may terminate that Quote but not other outstanding
            Quotes which iQ Media has not breached. Any termination of this Agreement shall
            cause all outstanding Quotes hereunder to terminate automatically. Promptly upon
            any termination of this Agreement, Customer shall return or destroy all copies and
            embodiments of iQ Media Materials of any type in its or any End-Users’ possession.
            iQ Media may retain and use all materials created on its platforms using the Services.
            The ownership, confidentiality, proprietary rights, indemnification, disclaimer,
            limitation of liability and miscellaneous provisions of this Agreement shall survive
            any termination, along with any other provisions hereof that, by their nature, are
            intended to survive.</p>
        <p>
            7. <u>Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</u>. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS
            IS”, WITH NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
            WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
            NON-INFRINGEMENT, FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL CODE, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS
            AND ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED OPERATION. IN NO EVENT WILL iQ MEDIA BE LIABLE TO
            CUSTOMER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL
            OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE OR DATA, IN CONNECTION
            WITH THE SERVICES, EVEN IF iQ MEDIA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
            DAMAGES OR LOSSES. iQ MEDIA’S ENTIRE LIABILITY, AND CUSTOMER’S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY,
            FOR ANY CLAIM OR ACTION (OR SERIES OF CLAIMS OR ACTIONS) RELATING TO THE SERVICES
            (WHETHER IN NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION), SHALL BE
            DIRECT DAMAGES NOT TO EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, THE AMOUNTS PAID BY CUSTOMER TO
            iQ MEDIA UNDER THE QUOTE(S) TO WHICH THE CLAIM OR ACTION RELATES IN THE TWELVE (12)
            MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING SUCH CLAIM OR ACTION.</p>
        <p>
            8. <u>Indemnity</u>. Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless iQ Media,
            its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, members,
            managers, employees and agents from all losses and expenses (including reasonable
            attorneys’ fees) related to any third-party claim, action or allegation (i) that
            arises from (i) Customer’s breach of this Agreement or use of the Services, or (if
            Customer has purchased Agency Access) (ii) that arises from the acts or omissions
            of an End-User or is brought by an End-User.</p>
        <p>
            9. <u>Amendments</u>. iQ Media may update this Subscription Agreement (but not the
            specific terms of a Quote) from time to time by e-mailing an updated version to
            Customer or e-mailing Customer a notice that an updated version of this Subscription
            Agreement is available on iQ Media’s website associated with the Services (currently
            <a href="http://www.iqmediacorp.com" target="_blank">www.iqmediacorp.com</a>). Any
            updates shall become effective thirty (30) days after notice is sent in this manner.
            If Customer objects to the new terms, it must notify iQ Media in writing within
            the thirty (30) day period; if Customer fails to do so and continues to use the
            Services, it shall be deemed to have accepted the updated version of this Subscription
            Agreement. If Customer does notify iQ Media of objections within the thirty (30)
            day notice period, then the existing version of this Subscription Agreement shall
            continue to apply to any outstanding Quotes for their remaining terms. However,
            Customer subsequently elects to allow any Quote to renew, then the Quote shall be
            governed by the then-current updated version of this Subscription Agreement during
            the renewal term. Likewise, any new Quote agreed to by Customer will be governed
            by the updated Subscription Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
            10. <u>Miscellaneous</u>. This Agreement (including the Quotes and additional terms
            referenced herein) is the complete and entire agreement between the parties and
            supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and communications with respect
            to the subject matter hereof. In the event of a conflict between the main body of
            this Subscription Agreement and a Quote, the Quote shall control with respect to
            the specific Services therein. Except as expressly provided herein, this agreement
            may not be modified except in a writing executed by both parties. Except where this
            Agreement permits e-mail notice, all notices under this Agreement shall be in writing
            and sent via first-class mail, return receipt requested, to the party at the address
            provided in the latest Quote or otherwise provided via notice; notices are effective
            upon receipt. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and all disputes
            shall be governed by, the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without giving
            effect to the conflicts of laws rules thereof. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue
            for the adjudication of any disputes relating to this Agreement shall be in the
            state and federal courts (including the appellate courts) for the Commonwealth of
            Pennsylvania, and the parties hereby consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such
            courts. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent
            of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however,
            that iQ Media may, without consent, utilize subcontractors to perform its obligations
            under this Agreement and either party may assign this Agreement to (i) an affiliate
            or (ii) a successor in connection with a merger or a sale of substantially all its
            assets.</p>

            by reference), Customer hereby subscribes for access to iQ Media’s media intelligence
            and research services. Access may be either agency-level access ("Agency Access")
            or self-service access ("Self-Service Access"), as specified in a Quote. The product
            features and accessible media types, as well as the fees and payment schedule for
            the services, shall be specified in each Quote. A Quote must be mutually executed
            by both parties to be binding and effective. At any time, Customer may also request
            iQ Media to perform custom or specialty services not included in iQ Media’s standard
            service offerings for Customer’s level of access; the features, pricing and any
            additional terms applicable to such services shall be specified in one or more "Custom
            Service Quotes," which shall be effective upon mutual execution by the parties and
            thereupon incorporated in this Agreement by reference. The services ordered by Customer
            from time to time and described in the Quotes are collectively referred to as the
            "Services."
        </p>
        <p>
            2. <u>Payment</u> Payments shall be made within thirty (30) days of the receipt
            of an invoice from iQ Media. Payments shall be made to iQ Media’s Billing Department,
            with an address of <b>10 Campus Boulevard, Newtown Square, PA 19073.</b> Returned
            or late payments may be subject to additional fees. If Customer fails to make any
            required payment, Customer shall also reimburse iQ Media for its reasonable costs
            of collection.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. <u>License</u> As more fully provided below, Customer’s license rights are determined
            by the level of access specified in the applicable Quote. Under no circumstances
            may Customer exceed (or permit a third party to exceed) the level of access granted
            in the Quote, or access or use content, features or functionality in the iQ Media
            platform or database that are not authorized for Customer’s level of access as provided
            in the Quote and this Agreement. In addition to the license terms below, Customer’s
            use of content removal functionality may be subject to additional terms, such as
            click-wrap agreements or terms of use, which shall supplement this Agreement and
            shall be binding upon Customer (and its End-Users, as defined below, if Customer
            has purchased Agency Access) with respect to such activities. Such additional terms
            are hereby incorporated and made a part of this Agreement by reference.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>If Customer has purchased Self-Service Access, the following license terms shall
                apply:</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            iQ Media grants Customer a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license
            during the term of each Quote to (i) access and use those features and functions
            of iQ Media’s proprietary online research platform specified in the applicable Quote
            to search, and create, store and view clips of, media content in the categories
            specified in such Quote, all solely for the purpose of time-shifted internal viewing
            and not for sale, licensing, re-broadcast, distribution, syndication or public display;
            and (ii) use iQ Media’s proprietary analytics platform to request media content
            data summaries to be used for Customer’s internal business purposes. Without limiting
            the foregoing, Customer shall NOT grant third parties access to the Services, the
            iQ Media content database or any content obtained from the database, or use the
            Services for service bureau-type activities. Customer’s license to access iQ Media’s
            platform and database is limited to the number of seats purchased by Customer. Each
            seat will be assigned an individual login and password. Each login and password
            may not be used by anyone within Customer’s organization other than the licensed
            user and may not be shared with any third party.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>If Customer has purchased Agency Access, the following license terms shall apply:</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            iQ Media grants Customer a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license
            during the term of each Quote to (i) access and use those features and functions
            of iQ Media’s proprietary online research platform specified in the applicable Quote
            to search, and create, store and view clips of, media content in the categories
            specified in such Quote; (ii) make such clips available in accordance with applicable
            law to End-Users who have a need for time-shifted viewing as part of their relationship
            with Customer, and not for sale, re-broadcast, distribution, syndication or public
            display, except with the prior consent of the applicable rights holders; and (iii)
            use iQ Media’s proprietary analytics platform to request media content data summaries
            to be used for Customer’s and its End-Users’ internal business purposes. As used
            herein, "End-User" means a customer, client or other constituent of Customer which,
            prior to receiving content from the iQ Media database, has executed a written contract
            with Customer containing restrictions on the use of media content and disclaimers
            that are fully consistent with and at least as strenuous as those in this Agreement.
            Customer’s license to access iQ Media’s platform and database is limited to the
            number of seats purchased by Customer. Each seat will be assigned an individual
            login and password. Each login and password may not be used by anyone within Customer’s
            organization other than the licensed user. Customer shall not share any login or
            password for iQ Media’s platform and database with any third party, shall not grant
            third parties access to the Services, and also shall not grant third parties access
            to content obtained from the iQ Media database except for End-Users in accordance
            with the license above. Customer is responsible for ensuring End-Users’ compliance
            with all laws and all other obligations applicable to Customer, whether under this
            Agreement or otherwise. In the event of a complaint from a rights holder concerning
            content provided to End-Users, Customer shall promptly provide iQ Media upon request
            with any information about End-Users who may have received the relevant content
            and shall take all actions requested to limit or terminate their right and ability
            to access or use such content. If iQ Media in good faith believes that a particular
            End-User is violating this Agreement, Customer shall also take all actions requested
            to deny such person further access to content from the iQ Media database.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>The following terms shall apply to both Self-Service Access and Agency Access:</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Customer shall immediately report to iQ Media any unauthorized access of a login
            and shall be responsible for all activities occurring under each login, whether
            authorized or not. Customer is solely responsible for complying with this Section
            3 and applicable copyright and other laws and shall not use, download, copy, modify,
            re-broadcast, distribute, perform or display media content in any infringing or
            illegal manner.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. <u>Fair Use Notice; Complaints and Improper Uses</u> CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
            iQ MEDIA IS AN ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDER ONLY, DOES NOT SELL, DISTRIBUTE OR SYNDICATE
            CONTENT AND DOES NOT OWN THE MEDIA CONTENT ACCESSIBLE IN THE iQ MEDIA DATABASE.
            ALL VIEWING, CLIPPING, DOWNLOADING, STORAGE, AND OTHER USAGE OF CONTENT IS STRICTLY
            LIMITED TO "FAIR USES" UNDER COPYRIGHT LAW. IF CUSTOMER’S INTENDED USAGE OF CONTENT
            MAY NOT CONSTITUTE "FAIR USE", iQ MEDIA STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT CUSTOMER CONTACT
            THE RELEVANT RIGHTS HOLDER TO OBTAIN A SUITABLE LICENSE IN SUCH CONTENT. In order
            to protect rights holders, iQ Media uses digital rights management technology ("DRM")
            to monitor and trace the usage and sharing of clips and block potentially infringing
            activities. Customer and (where Customer has purchased Agency Access) the End-Users
            shall not circumvent or disable iQ Media’s DRM, and Customer agrees that iQ Media,
            in its sole discretion, may immediately and without notice suspend or terminate
            access to the Services or clipped content if (a) Customer fails to pay any amount
            due under this Agreement; or (b) iQ Media receives a complaint from a rights holder
            about Customer or believes in good faith that Customer (or its End-Users, if applicable)
            have breached this Agreement. iQ Media shall have no liability whatsoever relating
            to any suspension, denial or termination of access to the Services or content where
            permitted by this Agreement.</p>
        <p>
            5. <u>Confidentiality and Proprietary Rights</u> Customer agrees to keep confidential
            and not to disclose to any third party, except as expressly permitted in this Agreement
            or with iQ Media’s prior written consent, iQ Media’s proprietary media player technology,
            media monitoring, clipping and business logic platforms, media content data summaries,
            and all other non-public business or technical information relating to the Services
            (collectively, together with any modifications, improvements, updates and customizations
            thereof, the "iQ Media Materials"), which Customer acknowledges constitute iQ Media’s
            proprietary information and trade secrets. Title to the Services and the iQ Media
            Materials (excluding the underlying media content) is at all times owned by iQ Media,
            along with all trademarks, service marks and trade names used with the iQ Media
            Materials and the Services and all associated goodwill. Customer agrees (i) not
            to copy, distribute, modify, display, de-compile, disassemble or reverse-engineer
            the Services or the iQ Media Materials, or combine or merge them with any other
            product, service or materials, without iQ Media’s prior written consent; and (ii)
            that any permitted copies shall bear iQ Media’s proprietary notices as appearing
            in the original material. All rights not expressly granted to Customer in this Agreement
            are reserved to iQ Media.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. <u>Term and Termination</u> This Agreement shall continue in force until terminated
            by either party in accordance with this Section 6. Unless different term provisions
            are specified in a Quote, the initial term of each Quote is twelve (12) months,
            after which the Quote will automatically renew for successive additional terms of
            equal length, at iQ Media’s then-current pricing for any ongoing Services if previously
            communicated by iQ Media, unless either party gives the other notice of non-renewal
            at least ninety (90) days before the renewal date. iQ Media may terminate this Agreement
            or any Quote hereunder upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Customer if
            Customer materially breaches the terms of either this Agreement or such Quote and
            such breach is not cured within the notice period; provided, however, that iQ Media
            may terminate immediately without prior notice in the circumstances described in
            Section 3 and 4 above. Customer may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’
            prior written notice to iQ Media if iQ Media materially breaches the terms of this
            Agreement and such breach is not cured within the notice period; however, if there
            is more than one Quote outstanding and a breach relates only to the Services provided
            under a particular Quote, then Customer may terminate that Quote but not other outstanding
            Quotes which iQ Media has not breached. Any termination of this Agreement shall
            cause all outstanding Quotes hereunder to terminate automatically. Promptly upon
            any termination of this Agreement, Customer shall return or destroy all copies and
            embodiments of iQ Media Materials of any type in its or any End-Users’ possession.
            iQ Media may retain and use all materials created on its platforms using the Services.
            The ownership, confidentiality, proprietary rights, indemnification, disclaimer,
            limitation of liability and miscellaneous provisions of this Agreement shall survive
            any termination, along with any other provisions hereof that, by their nature, are
            intended to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
            7. <u>Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</u> THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS
            IS", WITH NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
            WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
            NON-INFRINGEMENT, FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL CODE, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS
            AND ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED OPERATION. IN NO EVENT WILL iQ MEDIA BE LIABLE TO
            CUSTOMER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL
            OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE OR DATA, IN CONNECTION
            WITH THE SERVICES, EVEN IF iQ MEDIA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
            DAMAGES OR LOSSES. iQ MEDIA’S ENTIRE LIABILITY, AND CUSTOMER’S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY,
            FOR ANY CLAIM OR ACTION (OR SERIES OF CLAIMS OR ACTIONS) RELATING TO THE SERVICES
            (WHETHER IN NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION), SHALL BE
            DIRECT DAMAGES NOT TO EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, THE AMOUNTS PAID BY CUSTOMER TO
            iQ MEDIA UNDER THE QUOTE(S) TO WHICH THE CLAIM OR ACTION RELATES IN THE TWELVE (12)
            MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING SUCH CLAIM OR ACTION.
        </p>
        <p>
            8. <u>Indemnity</u> Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless iQ Media,
            its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, members,
            managers, employees and agents from all losses and expenses (including reasonable
            attorneys’ fees) related to any third-party claim, action or allegation (i) that
            arises from (i) Customer’s breach of this Agreement or use of the Services, or (if
            Customer has purchased Agency Access) (ii) that arises from the acts or omissions
            of an End-User or is brought by an End-User.
        </p>
        <p>
            9. <u>Amendments</u> iQ Media may update this Subscription Agreement (but not the
            specific terms of a Quote) from time to time by e-mailing an updated version to
            Customer or e-mailing Customer a notice that an updated version of this Subscription
            Agreement is available on iQ Media’s website associated with the Services (currently
            <a href="http://www.iqmediacorp.com" target="_blank">www.iqmediacorp.com</a>). Any
            updates shall become effective thirty (30) days after notice is sent in this manner.
            If Customer objects to the new terms, it must notify iQ Media in writing within
            the thirty (30) day period; if Customer fails to do so and continues to use the
            Services, it shall be deemed to have accepted the updated version of this Subscription
            Agreement. If Customer does notify iQ Media of objections within the thirty (30)
            day notice period, then the existing version of this Subscription Agreement shall
            continue to apply to any outstanding Quotes for their remaining terms. However,
            Customer subsequently elects to allow any Quote to renew, then the Quote shall be
            governed by the then-current updated version of this Subscription Agreement during
            the renewal term. Likewise, any new Quote agreed to by Customer will be governed
            by the updated Subscription Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
            10. <u>Miscellaneous</u> This Agreement (including the Quotes and additional terms
            referenced herein) is the complete and entire agreement between the parties and
            supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and communications with respect
            to the subject matter hereof. In the event of a conflict between the main body of
            this Subscription Agreement and a Quote, the Quote shall control with respect to
            the specific Services therein. Except as expressly provided herein, this agreement
            may not be modified except in a writing executed by both parties. Except where this
            Agreement permits e-mail notice, all notices under this Agreement shall be in writing
            and sent via first-class mail, return receipt requested, to the party at the address
            provided in the latest Quote or otherwise provided via notice; notices are effective
            upon receipt. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and all disputes
            shall be governed by, the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without giving
            effect to the conflicts of laws rules thereof. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue
            for the adjudication of any disputes relating to this Agreement shall be in the
            state and federal courts (including the appellate courts) for the Commonwealth of
            Pennsylvania, and the parties hereby consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such
            courts. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent
            of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however,
            that iQ Media may, without consent, utilize subcontractors to perform its obligations
            under this Agreement and either party may assign this Agreement to (i) an affiliate
            or (ii) a successor in connection with a merger or a sale of substantially all its
            assets.
